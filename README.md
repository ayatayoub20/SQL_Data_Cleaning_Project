# SQL_Data_Cleaning_Project
# World Layoffs Data Cleaning Using SQL

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset on global layoffs during 2022 using SQL. The project covers several data cleaning steps, including removing duplicates, standardizing data, and handling null values to ensure the dataset is ready for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL)
- Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022)

## Data Cleaning Steps:
1. Created a staging table to preserve raw data.
2. Identified and removed duplicate entries using SQL queries.
3. Standardized country names, date formats, and industry categories.
4. Managed null values, particularly in the `industry` and `total_laid_off` columns.
5. Removed unnecessary columns and rows that were not useful for analysis.

## SQL Code:
The full SQL code used in this project is available [here](link-to-SQL-file).

## Dataset:
The original dataset is available on Kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022).

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into effective data cleaning techniques using SQL. The dataset is now prepared for further analysis and visualization.
